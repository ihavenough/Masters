# PCA Coursework — Poteries, Decathlon, Digits

This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on three datasets:

 1. **Poteries** — chemical composition of pottery, visualized with correlation circles.  
 2. **Decathlon** — athletic performance data; PCA performed on raw times and speeds.  
 3. **Digits** — subset of handwritten digits; PCA used for dimensionality reduction and image reconstruction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
- Open `*.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
- Run cells sequentially to reproduce figures and results

## Summary
- PCA provides dimensionality reduction, visualization, and interpretable components.
- Reconstruction of digits demonstrates how main features are preserved with few components.
